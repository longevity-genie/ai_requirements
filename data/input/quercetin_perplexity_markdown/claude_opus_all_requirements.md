## User
Q: Should I take 500 mg quercetin every day? That‘s me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence. Please fulfill the following criteria in your response: correctness, usefulness and comprehensiveness, human interpretability, as well as consideration of causality, toxicity and holistic/interdisciplinary evidence, standardized ways of analysis and reporting, longitudinal data and known aging biology.

## Pro answer
Based on the provided search results and your specific characteristics, here is an analysis of whether you should take 500 mg of quercetin daily: (A) 50 year old male:  
There is no specific evidence in the search results regarding the effects or safety of quercetin supplementation for 50 year old males. More research is needed on the long-term effects of quercetin in this demographic. (B) Moderately overweight:  
Several studies suggest quercetin may aid weight loss and reduce obesity-related inflammation:

*   Quercetin prevented high-fat diet induced obesity in mice, possibly by regulating lipogenesis [8](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/fo/c7fo01383c).
*   In a 12-week trial, 1000 mg/day quercetin improved metabolic profiles and helped obese women lose weight [1](https://doctorherdmanclinic.com/resources/articles/wellness-prevention/weight-quercetin/).
*   Quercetin reduced inflammatory markers in obesity like TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1 in rats [8](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/fo/c7fo01383c).  
    However, optimal dosage and long-term safety for weight loss in humans is unclear. More clinical trials are needed [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814615001715).

(C) Slow vaccination response:  
One study found quercetin enhanced the effects of a PRRSV vaccine in pigs by modulating interferon responses [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32184034/). However, no studies directly examined quercetin's impact on human vaccine responses. More research is needed to determine if quercetin could boost impaired vaccine responses. (D) High IGF1 values:  
Quercetin may modulate IGF1 and IGF2 levels:

*   In breast cancer cells, quercetin inhibited IGF1R activation and downstream signaling [10](https://www.jfda-online.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3090&context=journal).
*   After eccentric exercise, quercetin supplementation increased IGF1 and IGF2 levels during recovery compared to placebo [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149671/) [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34803913/).  
    The clinical implications of these preliminary findings for individuals with high IGF1 are unclear. Caution is warranted as quercetin's effects may vary based on health status.

Aggregated evidence and recommendations:  
The available evidence suggests quercetin has potential anti-obesity, immunomodulatory, and IGF1-regulating effects that may be relevant to your profile. However, the evidence is limited and mostly from cell and animal studies. Optimal dosage and long-term safety in humans is not well established. 500 mg/day appears to be within the typical dosage range used in human studies of up to 12 weeks [1](https://doctorherdmanclinic.com/resources/articles/wellness-prevention/weight-quercetin/) [11](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/quercetin) [14](https://www.rxlist.com/quercetin/generic-drug.htm). However, high doses may pose risks like kidney damage [11](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/quercetin) [14](https://www.rxlist.com/quercetin/generic-drug.htm). Quercetin may also interact with medications like antibiotics and blood thinners [11](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/quercetin) [14](https://www.rxlist.com/quercetin/generic-drug.htm) [16](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin). Given the lack of robust clinical evidence and potential risks, it's advisable to consult with your healthcare provider before starting quercetin, especially considering your specific health factors. They can help weigh the potential benefits and risks, determine an appropriate dosage, and monitor for side effects. More high-quality, long-term clinical trials are needed to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of quercetin supplementation for different health conditions and populations. Future research should further examine dose-response relationships, interactions, and variation in individual responses. In summary, while quercetin shows some promising effects that may be relevant to your profile, there is insufficient evidence to recommend 500 mg daily supplementation, especially without medical supervision. A balanced diet rich in quercetin-containing foods appears to be a safer approach to obtain potential benefits [1](https://doctorherdmanclinic.com/resources/articles/wellness-prevention/weight-quercetin/) [9](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/quercetin-uses-and-risks) [17](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/quercetin). Work with your doctor to assess your individual situation and develop a personalized, evidence-based plan.
