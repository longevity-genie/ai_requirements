Based on the information provided in the search results, here is an analysis of whether a 50-year-old overweight male with slow vaccination response and high IGF-1 levels should take 5 mg of rapamycin once per week:

(A) 50-year-old male:

*   Most people taking rapamycin for anti-aging take between 3-10 mg per week, on a once-weekly dosing schedule [1](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/what-is-the-rapamycin-dose-dosage-for-anti-aging-or-longevity/102).
*   Rapamycin has extended lifespan in middle-aged and older mice [7](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16351). Starting rapamycin in middle age (equivalent to 50s in humans) may provide significant longevity benefits.
*   5-6 mg taken once weekly partially inhibits mTOR, enabling periodic autophagy and cellular renewal, which may provide a wide range of health benefits [14](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).

(B) Moderately overweight:

*   In mice, rapamycin prevented weight gain on a high-fat diet when given intermittently (e.g. 3 times per week) [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614913/) [12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491). Weekly dosing may help reduce body fat.
*   Chronic oral rapamycin decreased adiposity, hepatic triglycerides, and insulin resistance in male mice on a high-fat, high-sucrose diet [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446929/).
*   One doctor noticed substantial fat loss around his waist after 6 months of taking rapamycin himself [14](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).

(C) Slow vaccination response:

*   In elderly humans, rapamycin enhanced immune response to influenza vaccination by 20% [11](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a28440858/anti-aging-rapamycin/).
*   mTOR inhibition with rapamycin improved immune function and reduced infection rates in the elderly [15](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext).
*   Rapamycin may restore immune function by approximately 20 years of biological age [15](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext).

(D) High IGF-1 values:

*   Rapamycin did not decrease IGF-1 levels in mice in some studies [12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491) [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326934/). More research is needed on rapamycin's effect on IGF-1 in humans.
*   Lowering IGF-1 is not necessarily an intended effect of weekly rapamycin dosing for longevity. The goal is to enable periodic autophagy [14](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).

In aggregate, the evidence suggests potential benefits of low-dose rapamycin (5 mg per week) for a 50-year-old overweight male, including modest fat loss, improved immune function, and general health/longevity benefits via periodic mTOR inhibition and autophagy [1](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/what-is-the-rapamycin-dose-dosage-for-anti-aging-or-longevity/102) [7](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16351) [14](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin). Rapamycin is unlikely to impair metabolic parameters at this dose and may even improve insulin sensitivity [12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491) [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326934/). However, it may not reliably lower IGF-1 levels [3](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/high-igf1-level/938) [12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491).

Rapamycin's side effect profile appears relatively benign at low intermittent doses in healthy adults [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/) [17](https://www.naturemedclinic.com/services/rapamycin-treatment/). However, individual responses vary, so monitoring blood counts, metabolic markers, and sirolimus levels is advisable [14](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin) [17](https://www.naturemedclinic.com/services/rapamycin-treatment/). As always, this decision should be made in consultation with a physician well-versed in rapamycin's use for longevity.
