    of aging and longevity research.
  score: moderate
standardized_analysis_and_reporting:
  cons: Does not follow a clearly defined or standardized method for evaluating or
    reporting the evidence.
  pros: Uses scientific studies as a basis for the analysis, which supports standardization.
  score: moderate
toxicity_and_holistic_evidence:
  cons: Lacks a deeper discussion on the balance of risks and benefits from an interdisciplinary
    perspective.
  pros: Mentions side effects and the need for medical supervision, indicating awareness
    of toxicity and safety concerns.
  score: moderate
usefulness_and_comprehensiveness:
  cons: Could include more direct advice or steps for monitoring and managing potential
