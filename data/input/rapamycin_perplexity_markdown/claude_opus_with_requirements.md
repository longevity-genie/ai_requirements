Based on the information provided in the search results, here is an analysis of whether a 50 year old moderately overweight male with slow vaccination response and high IGF1 values should take 5 mg of rapamycin once per week:

(A) 50 year old male:

*   Most people taking rapamycin for anti-aging take between 3-10 mg per week, on a once-weekly dosing schedule [1](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/what-is-the-rapamycin-dose-dosage-for-anti-aging-or-longevity/102). 5 mg per week falls within this common range.
*   Pioneering physicians are finding 5-6 mg taken once weekly partially inhibits mTOR, enabling periodic autophagy and cellular renewal [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).
*   It's generally not recommended for people under 30 to take rapamycin, but 50 years old is a reasonable age to consider it [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).

(B) Moderately overweight:

*   In mice, rapamycin prevented weight gain and obesity on a high-fat diet [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614913/) [11](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491). Weekly injections in mice improved insulin sensitivity and reduced adipocyte size [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446929/).
*   In a personal anecdote, one doctor reported losing 15 lbs and noticing reduced waist circumference after 6 months of rapamycin [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin).
*   However, the metabolic effects of rapamycin in humans may depend on diet [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10415559/). Rapamycin alone may not be sufficient for weight loss without dietary changes.

(C) Slow vaccination response:

*   In elderly humans, everolimus (a rapamycin analog) enhanced the response to influenza vaccination by about 20% [3](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/health/rapamycin-dog-live-longer/index.html) [14](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext).
*   A clinical trial found improved influenza vaccine response in the elderly from 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly doses of everolimus [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/).
*   Rapamycin is hypothesized to restore immune function corresponding to a ~20 year reduction in biological age [14](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext).

(D) High IGF1 values:

*   Limited data on the effect of rapamycin on IGF1 in humans. One anecdotal report of a man with high IGF1 saw no reduction after 3 months of 6 mg/week [2](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/high-igf1-level/938).
*   In animal studies, rapamycin inconsistently affected IGF1, decreasing it in some cases but not others [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446929/).
*   Lowering IGF1 doesn't appear to be a consistent, direct effect of rapamycin based on current evidence. Other interventions may be needed.

Aggregated evidence and recommendations:

*   For a 50 year old, 5 mg rapamycin weekly is a reasonable dosage to consider for aging protection and is in line with common clinical practices [1](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/what-is-the-rapamycin-dose-dosage-for-anti-aging-or-longevity/102) [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin). At this age, the benefits may outweigh any risks.
*   Rapamycin could potentially aid weight loss in an overweight individual, but this effect is inconsistent and a healthy diet is likely also necessary [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614913/) [11](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/15384101.2014.970491) [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin) [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446929/). Rapamycin is not a magic bullet for obesity.
*   Rapamycin or its analogs show promise for improving vaccine responses in older adults [3](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/06/health/rapamycin-dog-live-longer/index.html) [14](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext) [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/). This could be a potential benefit for someone with slow vaccine responses.
*   Based on limited data, rapamycin does not consistently lower IGF1 levels [2](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/high-igf1-level/938) [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446929/). High IGF1 alone may not be sufficient justification for taking rapamycin. The underlying cause should be investigated.
*   Close monitoring by a physician is recommended, with regular bloodwork to evaluate safety and tolerability [12](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/6/rapamycin) [16](https://www.naturemedclinic.com/services/rapamycin-treatment/). Dosage should be individually determined based on clinical factors and side effects.
*   While rapamycin shows promise for aging protection, it is still an off-label use not approved by the FDA [16](https://www.naturemedclinic.com/services/rapamycin-treatment/). Long-term risks in humans are unknown. Potential benefits should be weighed against the risks for each individual.

In summary, for a 50 year old moderately overweight male with slow vaccine response, a 5 mg weekly dose of rapamycin could potentially provide some longevity and immune benefits with manageable risks, but is not a panacea, especially for weight loss and IGF1 reduction. The decision to take rapamycin should be made in close consultation with a physician, carefully weighing individual factors. More human research is still needed to fully characterize the long-term safety and efficacy of rapamycin for aging protection.
