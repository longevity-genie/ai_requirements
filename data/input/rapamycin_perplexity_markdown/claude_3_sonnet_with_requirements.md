Based on the information provided in the search results, here is an analysis of whether you, as a 50-year-old moderately overweight male with slow vaccination response and high IGF-1 levels, should take 5 mg of rapamycin once per week:

(A) 50-year-old male:

*   Most people taking rapamycin for anti-aging purposes take between 3-10 mg per week, with 5-7 mg being a common dose [2](https://www.rapamycin.news/t/what-is-the-rapamycin-dose-dosage-for-anti-aging-or-longevity/102).
*   In a study of healthy elderly people, a daily 1 mg dose for several weeks was safe and well-tolerated [7](https://www.aging-us.com/article/102355/text) [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/). This suggests a 5 mg weekly dose is likely to be safe for a 50-year-old male.

(B) Moderately overweight:

*   In mice, rapamycin reduced weight gain and increased energy expenditure on a high-fat diet [15](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092684). This indicates rapamycin may help manage weight.
*   However, metabolic side effects like insulin resistance can occur, especially at higher doses [9](https://www.aging-us.com/article/100688/text). Close monitoring of metabolic parameters would be prudent.

(C) Slow vaccination response:

*   Rapamycin has immunosuppressive effects at higher doses used in transplant patients [4](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/75/16/3279/605798/Rapamycin-Impairs-Antitumor-CD8-T-cell-Responses) [8](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext). However, lower intermittent doses may actually enhance immune function.
*   In elderly patients, a short course of low-dose rapamycin (0.5-1 mg/day) increased their response to influenza vaccine [8](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext). A weekly 5 mg dose may similarly boost vaccine responses.

(D) High IGF-1 levels:

*   Rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling, which is stimulated by growth factors like IGF-1 [1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010578) [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015133). By opposing IGF-1 signaling, rapamycin may help mitigate cancer risk associated with high IGF-1.
*   In fact, rapamycin is being studied as an anti-cancer therapy, in part due to its ability to inhibit IGF-1 and mTOR signaling pathways that drive tumor growth [17](https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2012202) [19](https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-13-170).

Overall, based on your profile, a 5 mg weekly dose of rapamycin appears to be a reasonable consideration, as it aligns with common dosing for anti-aging purposes and may provide metabolic and immune benefits. The inhibition of IGF-1 signaling could also be favorable given your high IGF-1 levels.

However, it's crucial to weigh potential benefits against risks. Rapamycin can cause side effects like mouth sores, impaired wound healing, and rarely pneumonitis [7](https://www.aging-us.com/article/102355/text) [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/) [14](https://cdn.caymanchem.com/cdn/msds/13346m.pdf). It may also interact with other medications. Careful monitoring by a physician experienced with rapamycin is essential.

Additionally, the long-term effects of rapamycin in humans are still unclear. Most safety data comes from higher doses used in transplant or cancer patients [7](https://www.aging-us.com/article/102355/text) [8](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2820%2930068-4/fulltext). More clinical trials are needed to fully define the safety and efficacy of rapamycin for anti-aging.

In summary, while a 5 mg weekly rapamycin dose appears to be a promising option based on your individual characteristics, it should only be used under close medical supervision after a thorough discussion of the potential risks and benefits. Lifestyle interventions and other medications should also be considered as part of a holistic approach to healthy aging.
