  score: good
known_aging_biology:
  cons: The response could have provided more context on the biological mechanisms
    of aging and how rapamycin may influence these processes.
  pros: The response mentions the role of mTOR in aging and the potential of rapamycin
    to mitigate some of the negative effects of elevated IGF-1.
  score: moderate
longitudinal_data:
  cons: The response does not include any information on the long-term effects of
    rapamycin use or the need for longitudinal studies to assess its safety and efficacy.
  pros: ''
  score: bad
standardized_analysis_and_reporting:
  cons: The response could have used a more standardized reporting format, such as
    the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework.
  pros: The response follows a structured format, addressing each characteristic separately
    and providing an aggregated analysis.
  score: moderate
toxicity_and_holistic_evidence:
  cons: The response could have included more information on the long-term toxicity
    of rapamycin and its effects on other organ systems.
  pros: The response mentions the potential side effects and drug interactions of
    rapamycin and emphasizes the need for medical supervision.
  score: moderate
usefulness_and_comprehensiveness:
  cons: The response could have included more information on the long-term safety
