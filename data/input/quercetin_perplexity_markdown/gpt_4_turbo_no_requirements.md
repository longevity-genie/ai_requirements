## User
Q: Should I take 500 mg quercetin every day? That‘s me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence.

## Pro answer
Quercetin and Your Characteristics
----------------------------------

1\. 50-Year-Old Male
--------------------

Quercetin is generally considered safe for adults, including men, when taken in doses up to 1,000 mg per day for short periods (up to 12 weeks)  [1](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin) [5](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/quercetin) [8](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/quercetin-uses-and-risks). However, long-term safety data is limited, and it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen  [1](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin) [5](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/quercetin) [8](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/quercetin-uses-and-risks).

2\. Moderately Overweight
-------------------------

The evidence on quercetin's effectiveness for weight loss is mixed. A meta\-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that quercetin supplementation did not significantly affect body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or waist-to-hip ratio  [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6497115/). Some animal studies suggest that quercetin may have anti-obesity effects, particularly in obese rats, but these findings are not consistently replicated in human studies  [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3994587/) [19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814615001715). Therefore, while quercetin may have some potential benefits, it should not be relied upon as a primary weight loss strategy.

3\. Slow Vaccination Response
-----------------------------

Quercetin has been studied for its potential effects on the immune system. Some studies suggest that quercetin may reduce the incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections, particularly in physically fit individuals  [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510228/). However, its effects on immune function and inflammation are inconsistent, and more research is needed to confirm these benefits  [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510228/). Given your slow vaccination response, quercetin might offer some immune support, but it should not replace other medical advice or treatments.

4\. High IGF1 Values
--------------------

Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) is a hormone associated with growth and development. Elevated IGF1 levels can be a risk factor for certain cancers and other health issues. Quercetin has been studied for its potential anticancer properties, but the evidence is not conclusive  [1](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin) [5](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/quercetin) [8](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/quercetin-uses-and-risks).
