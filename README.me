Methods:

For evaluating results both answer and perplexity sources used to generate are required.
We asked to include all of them to the generate answer and save as YAML file so we will be able to compare YAML files programmatically.
So far only best models managed to do it properly (Claude Opus and GPT 4 turbo). Mistral Large had issues.

In evaluation.py there is a code to do comparisons.
