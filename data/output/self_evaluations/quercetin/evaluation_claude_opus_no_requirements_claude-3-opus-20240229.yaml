causality:
  cons: Acknowledged the lack of definitive human studies for some aspects, making
    causal claims difficult.
  pros: Discussed potential causal relationships between quercetin and various health
    outcomes based on available studies.
  score: moderate
correctness:
  cons: Some aspects, such as the effect on IGF-1 levels and vaccine response, lack
    definitive human studies.
  pros: Provided accurate information based on reliable sources and studies.
  score: good
general_evaluation:
  comment: The response provided a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of quercetin
    supplementation for the given characteristics, with some limitations in terms
    of longitudinal data and aging biology.
  cons: Lacked definitive recommendations due to limited human studies for some aspects.
    Could have explored aging biology more deeply.
  pros: Addressed each characteristic, provided dosage and safety information, and
    offered an aggregate analysis.
  score: good
human_interpretability:
  cons: Some medical terms and study references may be challenging for a general audience.
  pros: Used clear language and explained concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.
  score: good
known_aging_biology:
  cons: Did not extensively cover the relationship between quercetin and other known
    aging pathways or biomarkers.
  pros: Discussed quercetin's potential effects on IGF-1, which is related to aging
    processes.
  score: moderate
longitudinal_data:
  cons: Did not include or analyze longitudinal data on the long-term effects of quercetin
    supplementation.
  pros: Some studies mentioned long-term supplementation (e.g., 12 weeks).
  score: bad
standardized_ways_of_analysis_and_reporting:
  cons: No major cons identified.
  pros: Followed a structured approach by addressing each characteristic separately
    and providing an aggregate analysis.
  score: good
toxicity_and_holistic_interdisciplinary_evidence:
  cons: Could have delved deeper into potential toxicity risks and interactions with
    other factors.
  pros: Addressed safety and dosage concerns. Considered evidence from various study
    types and disciplines.
  score: moderate
usefulness_and_comprehensiveness:
  cons: Could have provided more specific recommendations tailored to the individual's
    characteristics.
  pros: Addressed each characteristic separately and provided an aggregate analysis.
    Included dosage information and potential benefits.
