Q: Should I take 500 mg quercetin every day? That‘s me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence.

## Pro answer
Based on the information provided in the search results, here is an analysis of whether a 50-year-old moderately overweight male with slow vaccination response and high IGF-1 values should take 500 mg of quercetin daily: (A) 50-year-old male:

*   Quercetin is generally considered safe, with doses up to 1 g per day for 12 weeks showing no significant adverse effects in humans [3](https://www.drugs.com/npp/quercetin.html) [13](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin).
*   Typical dosage recommendations range from 250-500 mg per day [10](https://biogena.com/en/knowledge/guide/quercetin_bba_3982999).
*   No specific information was found regarding ideal dosage for 50-year-old males.

(B) Moderately overweight:

*   One study found that overweight subjects who took 150 mg quercetin per day had lower levels of harmful LDL cholesterol [16](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324170).
*   Another study showed quercetin supplementation reduced systolic blood pressure and oxidized LDL in overweight subjects with high cardiovascular disease risk [4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/quercetin-reduces-systolic-blood-pressure-and-plasma-oxidised-lowdensity-lipoprotein-concentrations-in-overweight-subjects-with-a-highcardiovascular-disease-risk-phenotype-a-doubleblinded-placebocontrolled-crossover-study/8DB47B7FB4C09E5D3995A2F3F577D473).
*   These studies suggest quercetin may provide cardiometabolic benefits for overweight individuals, but the dosages used were lower than 500 mg/day.

(C) Slow vaccination response:

*   Quercetin has immunomodulatory and antiviral properties that may theoretically help boost vaccine response [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510228/) [14](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01451/full).
*   However, no studies were found directly evaluating quercetin's impact on vaccination in humans with slow vaccine responses.

(D) High IGF-1 values:

*   Animal and cell studies indicate quercetin can inhibit IGF-1 signaling and reduce IGF-1-stimulated cell proliferation [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8595302/) [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865265/).
*   However, no human trials were found examining the effect of quercetin supplementation on circulating IGF-1 levels.

In aggregate, the available evidence suggests:

*   A daily quercetin dosage of 500 mg appears to be safe for most adults [3](https://www.drugs.com/npp/quercetin.html) [10](https://biogena.com/en/knowledge/guide/quercetin_bba_3982999) [13](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-294/quercetin).
*   This dose may provide cardiometabolic benefits for overweight individuals, although lower doses have been used in studies [4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/quercetin-reduces-systolic-blood-pressure-and-plasma-oxidised-lowdensity-lipoprotein-concentrations-in-overweight-subjects-with-a-highcardiovascular-disease-risk-phenotype-a-doubleblinded-placebocontrolled-crossover-study/8DB47B7FB4C09E5D3995A2F3F577D473) [16](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324170).
*   Quercetin's immunomodulatory and IGF-1 inhibiting properties are promising but have not been sufficiently evaluated in humans with slow vaccine responses or high IGF-1 [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8595302/) [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865265/) [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8510228/) [14](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01451/full).
*   More targeted human studies are needed to determine if a 500 mg daily quercetin dose is optimal for this individual's specific characteristics and health goals.

In conclusion, while 500 mg/day of quercetin is likely safe and may provide some general benefits, the current evidence is not definitive enough to universally recommend this dose based on the queried characteristics. The individual should discuss the potential risks and benefits with their healthcare provider to determine if quercetin supplementation is appropriate for their unique situation.
