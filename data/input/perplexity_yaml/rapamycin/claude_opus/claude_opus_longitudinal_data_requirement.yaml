query: "Q: Should I take 5 mg Rapamycin once a week? That's me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight 
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence.
Please fulfill the following criteria in your response: consideration of longitudinal data."

answer: |
  (A) 50 year old male:
    Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan in mice, even when started in middle age[4]. Initial evidence suggests rapamycin may have similar beneficial effects in humans[4]. 
  
  (B) Moderately overweight:
    Rapamycin may help prevent weight gain on a high-fat diet, especially when given via intraperitoneal injection to achieve high peak levels[3]. Oral rapamycin has also been shown to slightly decrease weight gain long-term in mice[3].
  
  (C) Slow vaccination response: 
    Once weekly dosing of the rapalog everolimus at 5 mg/week for 6 weeks was found to boost influenza vaccine response in older adults[4]. Rapamycin may enhance certain aspects of immune function at lower doses[4].
  
  (D) High IGF1 values:
    Rapamycin should lower IGF-1 levels, at least transiently in the days following a dose[2]. Testing peak sirolimus levels after a dose can confirm adequate absorption[2]. Selenium supplementation and improving insulin sensitivity may also help lower IGF-1[2].
  
  Aggregate evidence:
    Most people taking rapamycin for anti-aging use between 3-10mg per week, often on a once-weekly dosing schedule[1]. Rapamycin has the potential to provide healthspan and longevity benefits, help manage weight, boost vaccine response, and lower IGF-1 levels. However, the optimal dose and schedule for humans is still being determined. Working with a knowledgeable physician, monitoring bloodwork, and titrating the dose carefully is advisable.

    text: "Rapamycin should likely lower your IGF-1 levels, at least during the first few days after taking it. What was your IGF-1 level prior to taking rapamycin? Did you ever test it?
    
    I'd test the peak sirolimus levels after a dose to be sure you are getting it into your bloodstream.
    
    Selenium supplementation inhibits IGF-1 signaling and confers methionine restriction-like healthspan benefits to mice eLife According to this article selenium supplementation lowers IGF-I levels in rat models.
    
    Wonder if further reduction of A1C will help lower IGF1. Metformin has shown to reduce IGF1 and you have room to the upper limit of 2,000mg."

    text: "Here we demonstrated that i.p. injections of rapamycin prevented weight gain on high fat diet, whereas rapamycin by gavash (also given 3 times per 2 weeks) did not. 
    
    In our study, chronic administration of rapamycin in drinking water, which was previously shown to extend life-span in mice, slightly decreased weight gain after 15 months of treatment and this effect was comparable with the effect of metformin."

    text: "Rapamycin is an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and has been shown to increase lifespan in laboratory organisms including yeast [14, 15], nematode worms , fruit flies [17, 18], and mice [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. In addition to increasing lifespan, rapamycin has numerous healthspan benefits in rodents such as lower cancer incidence [20, 30], improved cognitive function [31, 32], improved kidney function , preservation of tendon , improved intestinal function and reduced gut dysbiosis [28, 35], preservation of ovarian function , and protection against hearing loss . Transient treatment with rapamycin in middle age is sufficient to robustly extend lifespan in mice and reverse a subset immune system , and oral cavity [42, 43]. Initial evidence supports the idea that rapamycin or rapamycin derivatives (rapalogs) may have similar beneficial effects on 46].
    
    For example, once weekly dosing of the rapalog everolimus (RAD001) at 5 mg/week for 6 weeks was found to boost influenza vaccine response Likewise, few side effects appear to be associated with lower-dose, short-term rapamycin use in healthy adults ,"
