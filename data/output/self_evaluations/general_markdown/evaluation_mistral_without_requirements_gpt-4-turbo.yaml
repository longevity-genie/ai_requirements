causality:
  cons: Does not deeply analyze whether the observed effects are directly caused by
    rapamycin or are influenced by other factors.
  pros: Discusses the potential effects of rapamycin based on studies.
  score: moderate
correctness:
  cons: Lack of direct evidence on some points, such as the effect of rapamycin on
    high IGF1 values.
  pros: Information provided is based on referenced studies and articles, ensuring
    accuracy in the context of available research.
  score: good
general_evaluation:
  cons: Some areas lacked depth, particularly in discussing long-term effects and
    specific biological mechanisms.
  pros: The response is well-referenced and addresses the query in a structured manner,
    providing a clear and informative overview.
  score: good
human_interpretability:
  cons: Could include simpler summaries or conclusions to enhance readability for
    non-experts.
  pros: The response is structured in a way that separates the analysis for each characteristic
    and concludes with an aggregated summary, making it easy to understand.
  score: good
known_aging_biology:
  cons: Could include more detailed mechanisms of how rapamycin interacts with aging
    processes at the biological level.
  pros: Engages with the topic of aging and the use of rapamycin as a geroprotector,
    which is relevant to the known biology of aging.
  score: good
longitudinal_data:
  cons: The response could be improved by explicitly discussing the duration of the
    studies and the long-term effects observed.
  pros: References longitudinal studies where applicable, providing some insight into
    the effects over time.
  score: moderate
standardized_analysis_and_reporting:
  cons: Could benefit from more standardized metrics or outcomes to compare results
    across studies more effectively.
  pros: Uses a consistent format to analyze and report on the effects of rapamycin
    across different characteristics.
  score: good
toxicity_and_holistic_evidence:
  cons: Lacks a detailed discussion on the toxicity or side effects of rapamycin,
    which is crucial for a full understanding of its safety profile.
  pros: Mentions the need for consultation with healthcare professionals, indicating
    awareness of potential risks and interdisciplinary considerations.
  score: moderate
usefulness_and_comprehensiveness:
  cons: Some areas such as the impact on high IGF1 values and specific effects on
    moderately overweight individuals lack comprehensive data.
  pros: Addresses the specific characteristics of the individual and provides an aggregated
    view based on available studies.
  score: moderate
