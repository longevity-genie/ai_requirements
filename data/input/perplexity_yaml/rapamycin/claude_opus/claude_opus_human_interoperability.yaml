query: "Q: Should I take 5 mg Rapamycin once a week? That's me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight 
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence.
Please fulfill the following criteria in your response: human interpretability."

answer: |
  (A) 50 year old male:
  Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan in mice, even when started in middle-age[13]. Low-dose rapamycin appears safe in elderly humans based on clinical trials[14][18]. However, rapamycin may have sex-specific effects, with some studies showing greater lifespan extension in female vs male mice[13]. More research is needed on optimal rapamycin dosing in middle-aged human males.

  (B) Moderately overweight:
  In mice, rapamycin prevents weight gain and obesity, even on a high-fat diet[1][11][12]. Weekly rapamycin injections (1.5-2 mg/kg) decreased body weight and fat mass in obese mice[8][12]. In humans, rapamycin decreases fat cell size and body weight[11]. Rapamycin's anti-obesity effects, along with its potential to improve metabolic health, suggest it may be particularly beneficial for overweight individuals. 

  (C) Slow vaccination response:
  Elderly humans treated with the rapamycin analog RAD001 (everolimus) at 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly for 6 weeks showed significantly improved response to influenza vaccination, especially those with low baseline antibody titers[5][15]. RAD001 also decreased the percentage of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, suggesting rejuvenation of the aged immune system[15]. Therefore, low-dose rapamycin/rapalogs may help boost vaccine responses in older adults.

  (D) High IGF1 values:
  Rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling, which is activated by growth factors like insulin and IGF-1. Elevated IGF-1 levels are associated with increased cancer risk[10]. By suppressing mTOR, rapamycin decreases cancer incidence in mice[10] and prevents some cancers in humans[11]. This suggests rapamycin could be especially beneficial for those with high IGF-1. However, rapamycin's effects on circulating IGF-1 levels in humans are not well-characterized.

  Aggregated evidence:
  Weekly rapamycin dosing in the 5-6 mg range appears to be a common, well-tolerated regimen that avoids side effects while still providing metabolic and immune benefits[1][5][15][16]. Your age, weight, and slow vaccine response suggest you may benefit from rapamycin's geroprotective effects. High IGF-1 is another reason to consider rapamycin for cancer prevention. 
  
  However, rapamycin is not approved for anti-aging, and long-term effects are unknown. Dose and frequency may need to be adjusted based on individual response. Close monitoring by a physician is advised. More clinical trials are needed to fully understand rapamycin's efficacy and safety as a geroprotector drug in humans.
