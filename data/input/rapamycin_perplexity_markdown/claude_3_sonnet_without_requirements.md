Based on the provided search results and your specific characteristics, here is my assessment on whether you should take 5 mg rapamycin once a week:

A) 50 year old male  
Several studies have shown that rapamycin can extend lifespan and healthspan in mice, even when started later in life [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10415559/) [9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2823%2900258-1/fulltext) [13](https://www.aging-us.com/article/102355/text). However, the optimal dosing and schedule for longevity in humans is still being investigated.

B) Moderately overweight  
Rapamycin has been found to prevent weight gain and decrease obesity in mice on a high-fat diet [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326934/) [14](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092684). Intermittent intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of rapamycin was particularly effective in preventing weight gain without causing metabolic abnormalities [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614913/) [14](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092684).

C) Slow vaccination response  
A key study showed that a 6-week treatment with 5 mg rapamycin (rapalog everolimus) once weekly improved the response to influenza vaccination in older adults [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/) [9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2823%2900258-1/fulltext). This suggests rapamycin may boost immune function at this dose.

D) High IGF1 values  
Rapamycin has been shown to decrease IGF1 levels in some studies [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/), which could be beneficial if your IGF1 is elevated. However, the implications of high IGF1 for rapamycin dosing are unclear.

Aggregating the evidence:  
The 5 mg once weekly dosing of rapamycin seems potentially beneficial for improving vaccination response [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/) [9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2823%2900258-1/fulltext) and preventing weight gain [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326934/) [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614913/) [14](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092684), which are relevant to your characteristics B and C. This dosing schedule also appears relatively well-tolerated in older adults based on the cited studies [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/) [9](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568%2823%2900258-1/fulltext). However, being a 50-year-old male, you are younger than the populations studied for longevity effects. The implications of high IGF1 levels for optimal rapamycin dosing are unclear from the provided information.

Overall, the 5 mg once weekly rapamycin dose could be reasonable to consider, especially if your priority is improving immune function and preventing weight gain. However, close monitoring under medical supervision would be advisable, as the long-term effects and optimal dosing strategy for longevity are still being investigated. Personalized dosing based on blood levels and side effects may ultimately be needed, as highlighted in some of the sources [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/) [13](https://www.aging-us.com/article/102355/text).
