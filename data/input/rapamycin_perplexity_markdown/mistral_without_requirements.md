Based on the search results provided, I will address each of your characteristics separately and then provide an aggregated response regarding the use of 5 mg Rapamycin once a week. Please note that this information should not be considered medical advice, and you should consult a healthcare professional before making any decisions about taking Rapamycin or any other medication.

(A) 50 year old male:  
According to [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/), a clinical study involved 150 subjects aged 50-85 who received either 5 mg or 10 mg of rapamycin once per week. This suggests that a 5 mg dose once a week has been studied in individuals within your age range.

(B) Moderately overweight:  
Some studies have investigated the effects of rapamycin on obese or overweight mice. For example,  [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326934/) discusses the impact of rapamycin on mice with a high-fat diet, and [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563990/) mentions a study where rapamycin protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to support or refute the use of 5 mg rapamycin once a week specifically for moderately overweight humans.

(C) Slow vaccination response:  
There is evidence that rapamycin may improve vaccination responses. In [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/), a study showed that everolimus (a rapamycin derivative) at 0.5 mg daily and 5 mg weekly improved influenza vaccination responses in adults aged 65 or older. Another study mentioned in [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643772/) found that a combination of BEZ235 and 0.1 mg everolimus daily improved influenza vaccination responses. However, these studies used different doses and schedules than the 5 mg once a week you mentioned.

(D) High IGF1 values:  
The search results provided do not discuss the relationship between rapamycin and high IGF1 values. Therefore, I cannot provide any information on this aspect.

Aggregated evidence:  
Based on the search results, there is some evidence that rapamycin has been studied in individuals within your age range (50-85 years old) and that it may improve vaccination responses. However, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the use of 5 mg rapamycin once a week specifically for moderately overweight individuals or those with high IGF1 values. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional before making any decisions about taking Rapamycin or any other medication.
