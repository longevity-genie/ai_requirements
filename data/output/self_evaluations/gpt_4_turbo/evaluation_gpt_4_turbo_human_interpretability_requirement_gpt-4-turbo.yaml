causality:
  cons: Does not fully explore or explain the causal mechanisms behind how Rapamycin
    affects these conditions.
  pros: Acknowledges the effects of Rapamycin on certain conditions like immune function
    and IGF1 levels.
  score: moderate
correctness:
  cons: Some statements could benefit from more specific data or broader studies to
    confirm findings.
  pros: The information provided is accurate based on current research and sources
    cited.
  score: good
general_evaluation:
  cons: Could improve in areas like causality, toxicity, and longitudinal analysis
    to enhance the depth and safety of the advice.
  pros: The response is informative, based on evidence, and addresses the user's situation
    with a personalized approach.
  score: good
human_interpretability:
  cons: Some medical terms or mechanisms might still be too complex without further
    simplification.
  pros: The language is clear and accessible, making the scientific information understandable
    for non-experts.
  score: good
known_aging_biology:
  cons: Could expand on how these biological mechanisms interact with the specific
    characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, weight).
  pros: Correctly connects Rapamycin's mechanism of action with known pathways in
    aging biology, such as mTOR inhibition.
  score: good
longitudinal_data:
  cons: Does not provide or discuss longitudinal data to assess long-term effects
    and outcomes.
  pros: References some studies with treatment durations.
  score: bad
standardized_analysis_and_reporting:
  cons: Could benefit from a more standardized reporting structure or inclusion of
    systematic reviews/meta-analyses.
  pros: Uses scientific studies and clinical trial data to support statements.
  score: moderate
toxicity_and_holistic_evidence:
  cons: Lacks a detailed discussion on potential side effects or long-term toxicity
    of Rapamycin.
