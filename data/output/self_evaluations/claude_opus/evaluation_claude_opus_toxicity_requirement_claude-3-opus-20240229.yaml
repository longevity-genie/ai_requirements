    to all readers.
  pros: The response is written in clear, easy-to-understand language and explains
    the reasoning behind the assessment.
  score: good
known_aging_biology:
  cons: More detailed discussion of the role of mTOR and other aging pathways could
    have been included.

  pros: The response follows a structured format, addressing each characteristic separately
    and providing an overall assessment.
  score: moderate
toxicity_and_holistic_evidence:
  cons: More discussion of potential side effects and the need for physician supervision
    could have been included.
  pros: The response considers the potential toxicity of rapamycin and notes that
    the 5 mg/week dose is generally well-tolerated.
  score: good
usefulness_and_comprehensiveness:
