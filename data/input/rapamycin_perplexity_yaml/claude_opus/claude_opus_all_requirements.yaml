query: "Should I take 5 mg Rapamycin once a week? That's me: (A) 50 year old male (B) Moderately overweight (C) Slow vaccination response (D) High IGF1 values. Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence. Please fulfill the following criteria in your response: correctness, usefulness and comprehensiveness, human interpretability, as well as consideration of causality, toxicity, holistic/interdisciplinary evidence, standardized ways of analysis and reporting, longitudinal data, and known_aging_biology."

answer: |
  Based on the provided information and criteria, taking 5 mg of rapamycin once a week may be beneficial, but should be done under medical supervision. Here is an analysis of each characteristic:
  
  (A) 50-year-old male: Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in mice, even when started in middle age[1][15]. In humans, low-dose rapamycin appears to be well-tolerated in older adults[16][19].
  
  (B) Moderately overweight: Rapamycin can prevent weight gain and decrease obesity in mice on a high-fat diet[2][13][14]. In humans, rapamycin may decrease the size of fat cells and body weight[13].
  
  (C) Slow vaccination response: Low-dose rapamycin (5 mg/week) has been shown to boost influenza vaccine response in older adults[16][19]. This suggests rapamycin could improve immune function in individuals with suboptimal vaccine responses.
  
  (D) High IGF-1 values: Rapamycin inhibits mTOR, which is activated by growth factors like IGF-1. High IGF-1 levels are associated with increased cancer risk[15]. By reducing mTOR activity, rapamycin may mitigate some of the negative effects of elevated IGF-1.
  
  Aggregated evidence suggests that a once-weekly 5 mg dose of rapamycin is a common and relatively safe regimen for potential anti-aging benefits[4][17]. This dosing schedule appears to minimize side effects while still providing therapeutic effects[7][10][12][13].
  
  However, rapamycin can have side effects and may interact with other medications[11][15][19]. Long-term safety data in humans is limited. Therefore, rapamycin should only be taken under the guidance of a physician experienced in its use for anti-aging purposes. Regular monitoring for side effects and adjustments to dosage may be necessary based on individual response[8][20].
