query: "Should I take 5 mg Rapamycin once a week? That's me: (A) 50 year old male (B) Moderately overweight (C) Slow vaccination response (D) High IGF1 values. Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence."

answer: |
  (A) 50 year old male:
  Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in mice when started in middle-age or later[1][9]. In humans, low-dose rapamycin (0.5-5 mg per week) appears to be well-tolerated in older adults[3][13].

  (B) Moderately overweight: 
  In mice, rapamycin prevents obesity and weight gain on a high-fat diet[1][7][11]. In overweight humans, low-dose rapamycin may help improve metabolic health and insulin sensitivity[3][15].

  (C) Slow vaccination response:
  Low-dose everolimus (a rapamycin derivative), at 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly, improved the response to influenza vaccination in older adults, especially those with low baseline responses[3][13][14]. This suggests rapamycin could help boost vaccine efficacy.

  (D) High IGF1 values:
  Rapamycin inhibits mTOR, a key regulator of IGF1 signaling[18]. By reducing IGF1 activity, rapamycin may help lower cancer risk and slow aging[8][12]. However, the optimal rapamycin dose for lowering IGF1 in humans is unknown.

  In aggregate, the evidence suggests that for a 50-year-old overweight male with slow vaccine response and high IGF1, a rapamycin dose of 5 mg once per week could potentially provide anti-aging and metabolic benefits with a favorable safety profile[1][3][4][13]. However, rapamycin should only be used under medical supervision after carefully weighing the risks and benefits for each individual[5][15].
