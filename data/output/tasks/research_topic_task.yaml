Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, has been studied for its potential anti-aging and healthspan-promoting effects. Considering your characteristics, here's a breakdown of the evidence:

(A) 50-year-old male:
Rapamycin has been shown to increase lifespan in male mice (1). A study on human subjects found that rapamycin treatment improved immune function in older adults (2). As a 50-year-old male, you may benefit from rapamycin's potential anti-aging effects.

(B) Moderately overweight:
Rapamycin has been found to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce body weight in obese mice (3). However, a human study on obese individuals found that rapamycin treatment did not result in significant weight loss (4). As a moderately overweight individual, rapamycin may not have a significant impact on your weight.

(C) Slow vaccination response:
Rapamycin has been shown to enhance immune function in older adults (2). A study on mice found that rapamycin treatment improved vaccine responses (5). As someone with a slow vaccination response, rapamycin may help improve your immune response.

(D) High IGF1 values:
Rapamycin has been found to decrease IGF1 levels in mice (6). A human study on cancer patients found that rapamycin treatment reduced IGF1 levels (7). As someone with high IGF1 values, rapamycin may help decrease your IGF1 levels.

Aggregating the evidence, taking 5 mg of rapamycin once a week may have potential benefits for you, particularly in terms of anti-aging and immune function. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the potential risks and benefits of rapamycin treatment, as well as to monitor your response to the medication.
