query: "Should I take 5 mg Rapamycin once a week? That's me:
(A) 50 year old male
(B) Moderately overweight 
(C) Slow vaccination response
(D) High IGF1 values.
Please consider my four characteristics separately, and then please aggregate the evidence."

answer: |
  (A) 50 year old male:
  Rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan in mice even when started in middle-age[10]. In humans, low-dose rapamycin (0.5-5 mg per week) appears to be well-tolerated in older adults with few side effects[1][3][4][18]. 
  
  (B) Moderately overweight:
  In mice, rapamycin prevents weight gain and obesity, even on a high-fat diet[2][11][12]. In humans, rapamycin may help reduce body weight and fat mass[11]. Weekly dosing of 1.5 mg/kg was effective for reducing weight gain in mice on a high-fat diet[12].
  
  (C) Slow vaccination response: 
  Low-dose everolimus (a rapamycin derivative), at 0.5 mg daily or 5 mg weekly for 6 weeks, significantly improved the response to influenza vaccination in older adults, especially those with low baseline responses[3][14]. This suggests rapamycin could boost vaccine efficacy.
  
  (D) High IGF1 values:
  Rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling, which is activated by growth factors like IGF1[18]. Lowering mTOR activity may be beneficial, as it is linked to aging and age-related diseases. However, no studies directly examined rapamycin's effect on IGF1 levels.
  
  In aggregate, once weekly dosing of 5-10 mg rapamycin appears to be a common regimen for anti-aging purposes that is generally well-tolerated[1][3][6][7][13]. It may provide benefits for body weight, immune function, and longevity, with a favorable safety profile at low intermittent doses. However, rapamycin is not approved for this use and long-term effects are unknown. Consultation with a physician is advised before starting any rapamycin regimen. More research is needed on rapamycin's impact on IGF1 levels specifically.
